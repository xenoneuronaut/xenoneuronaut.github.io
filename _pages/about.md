They call me Elin. I call me MindNomad. I am a #psychonaut: an explorer of the human condition, my vessels are altered states of consciousness and I travel through the labyrinthine caverns and sibylline depths of the mind. My journey started 22 years ago.

You have found a trail leading to my online mind. Here is a small map of some of the defining neural pathways:

I enjoy navigating through bodies of fluid consisting mainly of H2O and various compounds of chlorine.

However, I prefer those liquid spaces which in addition to the chlorine also contain a decent number of sodium ions in such saltier waters there are usually more fish and seaweed to be found. And I am fond of feasting on thoseï¿½ both with my eyes and with my mouth.

As a #logophile and polyglot, I collect words and devour languages. My favourite of the latter is French, but I'm more proficient at Russian. I grew up in a country communicating in Dutch, but at times perused small streets speaking Swedish to my father.

I like walks, preferably outside. My lungs thrive in the coldest of airs. Invigorating chills run all along my meridians when I gulp down the glacial gases of the world's winds. And the cold oxygen electrifies my brain reactivating my consciousness. My #mycomania makes me go mad about mushrooms & mycelial networks.
