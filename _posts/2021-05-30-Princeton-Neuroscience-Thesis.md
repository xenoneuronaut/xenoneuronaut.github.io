This is a copy of the thesis I submitted to the Neuroscience department at Princeton University for towards the fulfillment of my degree requirements. This piece was written in 2 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic, self-isolated in libraries, following a prolonged period of personal practice and theoretical research on the topic. Though I am personally not incredibly pleased with the result - I learned a great deal about the research process, and developed a new-found respect for the scientific method, and neuroscientists in general.

My aim was to write for a layman audience - which my professors did not support. So -here is the file for your viewing - if there is ever any curiosity on the topic!
