## *Here we go!*

I found out about Roberts’s book while spending the summer after my sophomore year at university living and working in a monastery in the mountains of Vermont. It was after several hours of repetitively sandpapering kitchen shelves that I came across one of Roberts’s talks on YouTube titled “*Molecules, Mindstates & Mystical Experiences: Psychotechnologies.*” I was enticed. No longer could I stay as monastically mindful as residents were expected to remain, and so I secretly succumbed to my curiosity to listen along as I sandpapered – how could I not? After finishing the video and completing an online search for Thomas B. Roberts, I quickly determined that I should get my hands on his book *MindApps*, so I did.

“This book is about mental vastness,” reads the author’s note, and “how exciting,”_ Roberts announces, that “we are advancing to a new era of mind design” (p.25). I was in the right place, opening the right pages, reading the right words.

In *MindApps*, Roberts repackages psychotechnologies such as psychedelics, various mindbody practices, and naturalistic states, e.g., Near Death Experiences (NDEs), in terms of mindapps. This sort of framing makes it easier to conceive of mindapps in a modular and combinatorial fashion. Mindapps can be installed to our brain-body complexes to produce a vast array of altered states of consciousness, or mindbody states, as Roberts writes for clarity (consciousness is still a very ambiguous term with too many meanings to establish any firm consensus).

_MindApps_ is an encouragingly speedy read that is chronologically, conceptually, and thematically sectioned out chapter by chapter. Roberts begins with a brief autobiographical account of his journey through the academic world, his discovery of the psychedelic and transpersonal realms, as well as his early encounters with “greats” in the field such as Stanislav Grof and Huston Smith. Already in 1981, Roberts started teaching a psychedelics course in higher education – the first of its kind, and in 1985 commemorated Bicycle Day as its founder. These are just a few of his curious contributions to the blossoming psychedelic renaissance.

With Roberts’s background and journey in mind, the following chapters describe the concept of mindapps and their role in the Multistate theory for mind design. Multistate theory is a framework for thinking about and working in a paradigm that embraces the vast repertoire of mindbody states that arise through the application of mindapps. In a more active key - the “_multistate theory promotes the construction of new mindbody states and their exploration, refinement, and development_” (p. 128).

Before reviewing the ways in which mindapps and multistate theory can contribute to the sciences, arts and humanities, Roberts lays the foundations of multistate theory through measured detailing of concepts that are necessary to move beyond the singlestate fallacy (the exclusionary biased assumption that the ordinary mindbody state is the only one that is worthwhile) into one that works with and from a vast repertoire of mindbody states. Fellow academics are encouraged to consider how a multistate approach to research is not only more sincere, but also far more accurate and logical.

One of the more auspicious notions Roberts brings to the table is the potential that psychedelic mindapps can have in reinvigorating the gusto in humanities departments. Both fascinating and valid research can be conducted on and in various mindbody states in the humanities. Psychedelic mindapps can be used as _ideagens_ or _aesthetigens_ for generating new ideas or enhancing aesthetic sensitivities respectively. Departments of Religion could also make do with a little more entheogenic endeavors, giving rise to experience-based studies of spiritual traditions.

The conceptual stage is set for an epoch of advanced mind design and the interdisciplinary application of mindapps in academia, business, policy and the arts. Roberts bridges the present paradigm that favors a single mindbody state to a future paradigm that incorporates both a multitude of uncharted and well-known mindbody states that have mostly been confined to only certain ritual, recreational, experimental and therapeutic contexts. Psychonauts can begin to aspire to new heights and dimensions of expression, as well as practical and methodological explorations of the mind, becoming what may be called multistate scholars. If more people were to read _MindApps_, that future may arrive with greater swiftness. I encourage such reading, since even individuals who have not had much exposure to psychedelic concepts and writing would be able to easily digest the content of this book.

Regardless, even to longstanding experts in psychedelic and transpersonal fields of inquiry, as well as to young inquisitive thinkers, _MindApps_ is a fun and informative update to one’s frames of thinking. I can envision a future wherein _MindApps_ is read as an introductory text in courses and programs on the development of mindapps, or mind design in general.

Before rounding off, there are a few more elements to take note of – these additional editorial touches make the read more engaging, thought provoking, and structurally accessible. The text formatting with bold references and italicized terminology, alongside changes in font sizes and styles helps to delineate and chunk information into related sections. Chapters open with alluding quotations, and end with engaging questions that deepen each chapter’s theme. Roberts also adds an idea or two for activities and initiatives to undertake in pursuit of answering those questions – something to try in a variety of mindbody states!

To conclude with another brief anecdote:

One day, adventure called upon the multistate scholar within me. I set out on my university campus to complete some fieldwork for an anthropology course. I was beholden by an inquisitive trickster mood and so decided to conduct my field research in a non-ordinary mindbody state. By happenstance, I stumbled upon a prospective graduate student who had come to be interviewed by the neuroscience department. The recognition was almost immediate – the multistate scholars and neuroscientists within us shook proverbial hands as we engaged in lengthy discussions on the exploration of the brain from multistate perspectives. I had encountered another multistate scholar – in the wild. Though academia may appear to still be enshrouded by the singlestate fallacy, this serendipitous encounter hints at the existence of burgeoning multistate scholars roaming campuses all across the globe.

_MindApps_ is a mindapp in and of itself. An invigorating, quick and clear read – upload _MindApps_ to the brain’s linguistic centers and let the words embed neural networks with new meaning, altering one’s operative conceptual frameworks.

> Onwards from the status quo and toward a multistate world! May minds design more minds and may Mind discover Mind.
